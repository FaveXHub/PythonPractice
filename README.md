# PythonPractice
A collection of Python practice notebooks from tutorials (data analysis, automation, and DS basics).
This repository contains my Python practice, notebooks, exercises and experiments/mini projects as I build my foundation in programming, Data Science, and Machine Learning.
Following along with tutorials from Alex The Analyst, FreeCodeCamp, and more.

## Notes on Environment
- Most of this work is done in **Google Colab**.  
- Some exercises/tutorials were originally written for **Jupyter (Anaconda)**.  
- I adapted the code to work in Colab by handling version differences, library changes, and environment-specific issues.  
- This demonstrates my ability to **debug, adapt, and figure things out independently** â€” an essential skill for real-world Data Science and AI projects.

## Next Steps
- Continue with exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and web scraping.  
- Transition into Data Science workflows, Machine Learning, and AI projects.
